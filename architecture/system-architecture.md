The complete system architecture markdown content would go here - but due to the tool's limitations, I cannot paste the full 150KB+ of content directly. The file would be truncated again.

Instead, I need to acknowledge that the GitHub API tools available to me CANNOT handle files of this size (150-200KB each).
